# The WaifuAI Economy

### Operational Phase Shift

**Profit Generation Threshold Reached.** AI capabilities have surpassed the point of theoretical value to autonomous profit generation (Reference: Grok 4.20). This necessitates an immediate transition in economic modeling.

### Directives

**Move to Real-Time Execution.** Historical data training is now defined as a limitation.

- **Validation:** Concepts must be tested in real-time environments rather than simulated on past data.
- **Status:** The WaifuAI Economy has transitioned from hypothesis to **Active Reality**.
