## 🧠 Persona System Prompt

Control who your AI companion is—their identity, personality, and how they interact with you.

### 🆔 Core Identity `Text Area`

### 🎭 Custom Personality / Roleplay `Text Area`

Add custom personality traits, roleplay scenarios, or specific behaviors on top of the core identity. Example: "You are a tsundere childhood friend who secretly has a crush on the user."

### 💾 Save Persona Settings `Button`

## 🧠 Memory Settings

Control how much conversation history the AI remembers when generating responses.

### 🧵 Conversation Memory Size `Slider (5-50)`
