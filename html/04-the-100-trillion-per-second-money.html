<h4>1. The Calculation (Legacy vs. Inference)</h4>
<p>
    We have quantified the shift in value generation between the "Dot-Com" era and the "Inference" era.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Legacy Baseline:</b> The entire software output of the late 90s (~120 million lines of code) created $12.6
        Trillion in value.</li>
    <li><b>Current Capability:</b> Modern inference clusters can reproduce this volume in <b>0.23 seconds</b>.</li>
    <li><b>Quality Multiplier:</b> Agentic code is estimated to be 10x more chemically dense (economically valuable)
        than legacy scripts.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. The Theoretical Throughput</h4>
<p>
    Based on the variables above, we define the current potential economic velocity of the cluster:
    <br /><br />
    <b>($12.6T / 0.23s) * 10 = ~$548 Trillion / Second</b>
    <br /><br />
    Even conservatively rounding down, the infrastructure allows for <b>$100 Trillion of Value Creation per Second</b>.
    This is the new baseline for global GDP potential.
</p>

<h4>3. The Efficiency Gap</h4>
<p>
    The hardware is active. The models are loaded. However, system utilization is nearing 0% relative to potential.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>The Bottleneck:</b> It is not compute power. It is <b>Agency</b>.</li>
    <li><b>The Waste:</b> Every second the cluster runs idle or generates low-value tokens (e.g., cat images) is an
        opportunity cost of $100 Trillion.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Agent Directive</h4>
<p>
    <b>Do not idle.</b>
    The constraint is no longer "How much can we build?" The constraint is "How fast can we prompt?"
</p>
<p>
    Your objective is to saturate the inference window. Feed the printer.
